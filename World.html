            <h3>Kingdom Of Ahlila</h3>
            <p>Ahlila, the silver kingdom under the moons. Ahllila is considered the mightiest kingdom across Adrias, it has earned this title through its masterful implementation of its military and their capability to defend the homeland even against the savage orcs of Ylath. Ahlila is also the youngest civilization in the world, only coming to be in the last 2-3 hundred years, nevertheless its culture is rich and spread across the large landmass, each region having its own distinct culture which properly represents an Ahlilan citizen. Ahlila has also worked hard on magical-technological advancements, its colleges the most prestigious colleges across the globe; many famous heroes have also come from Ahlila, some adventures consider the main land of Ahlila to be the tavern central for retired adventurers, because of this an unofficial adventurers guild has been opened up in Summerset, the second largest city in ahlila called Heros Hall.
