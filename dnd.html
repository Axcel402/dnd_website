      <h1>About The World</h1>
      <p>
        The world of Adrias..a rich planet filled with wonder and adventure;
        home to the homebrew campaign "uncanny crew" the world is massive with
        its own pantheon and new planes one could explore if they are so daring.
        from the massive kingdom of ahlila to the war torn empire of mishun,
        this world has many campaign opportunities for all to explore.

            <h3>The Uncanny Crew</h3>
            <p>From 1, to 3, to 4, to 1000 according to one member, th Uncanny crew go by a diffrent name in ahlila, The Summer 7..or 8, everyone has lost track at this point; regardless this group consists of Lucious(The Kenku), Aventina The Storm Sorceress, Beatrice Marley The Last Centaur, Seldom The Pin-Cushion, Gem Nordstorm The Blacksmith, Mirai Miku The Time-Blessed, And Haku The Neko Princess. There are other that make up the uncanny crew, but those are a lot of names you might not remember, just know that this group is very disfunctional, and if the world wasnt ending they would've killed each other by now (atleast thats what the dungeon master thinks) </p>

            <h3>Ahlila</h3>
            <p>The Kingdom Of Ahlila is the youngest kingdom, but quickly became one of--if not the most influential and powerful kingdom across the world. Even though the entire kingdom has been united under the Silverwood banner, the cultures shift dpending on the regions, towards the south within the frost covered land, the folks here are rugged no nonsense people, something that is required to survive here, while those in the North are more flamboient, enjoying the luxuries provided by living in close proximity to high nobility. regardless, Ahlila has a strong military presence, which is needed giving the threats which roams the lands and make some portions of the kingdom inhabitable.  </p>

          <p>Here, many of the cities can be located due to the safety provided in this region. there are still ancient secrets scattered in its forests and lakes, but compared to the rest of the kingdom (besides the north) the main land is much safer.</p>

          <h3>Northern Ahlila</h3>
          <p>The Nothern region of Ahlila is where the capital is located. the entire region is vast and open with very little woodlands around, but the magical weave here tends to spike around this region which can either be extremly awsome to witness, or terrifying.</p>

          <h3>Southern Ahlila</h3>
          <p>The Southern region is arguably the most dangerous region in Ahlila, not only due to the cold tempreture, but the vast amounts of creatures which call this place home. guards wont patrol the streets outside the cities, leaving most of the region to be lawless; the cold goddess was the law in these parts.</p>

She makes sure that her paladins take up the mantle of heroes, paladins and clerics are rare within her order since you have to have the qualities of a hero, it doesn’t mean being lawful good and following things strictly, it’s doing what’s right for the sake of those you fight for. Paladins and clerics of teneas can be the light of your civilization or the spark which starts the flame. No matter what, they will do what’s right.
